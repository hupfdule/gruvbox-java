Gruvbox Look & Feel for Java and Netbeans inspired by the
{gruvbox-homepage}[Gruvbox Colorscheme for Vim].

This project provides three artifacts that are meant to be used together,
but can as well be used each on their own:
                                   j
gruvbox-laf:: A Java Swing Look and Feel

gruvbox-laf-netbeans:: A Look and Feel for the {netbeans-homepage}[Netbeans IDE]
+
This Look & Feel is intended to be used together with the
corresponding netbeans colorscheme.

gruvbox-netbeans-colorscheme:: A colorscheme for syntax highlighting in the {netbeans-homepage}[Netbeans IDE]

WARNING: This Look & Feel is still a work in progress and may contain some
glitches. Please file an {issue-page}[Issue] if find any.

Variants
--------

This Look & Fell provides different variants (dark and light) of Gruvbox.
However, the gruvbox-netbeans-colorscheme is only available in a single
dark variant at the moment.
